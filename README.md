The travel app built with Flask, Python, and machine learning models provides users with a personalized travel cost estimator by predicting accommodation and transportation expenses based on destination, duration, traveler demographics, and travel preferences. Using a dataset of past travel details, the app preprocesses input data by encoding categorical features (like destination, accommodation type, and traveler nationality) and then feeds it into a **Random Forest Regressor** model for prediction. This model calculates expected accommodation and transportation costs, allowing travelers to plan their budgets more accurately. By deploying the app via Flask and Docker, users gain easy access to real-time estimates through a web interface, simplifying travel cost estimation and enhancing the planning experience. Postman can also be used alongside this app for API testing, allowing developers to validate endpoint responses and improve the modelâ€™s accuracy over time.
